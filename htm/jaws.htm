<h1>Interchangeable Jaws</h1>

<p>There are five different interchangeable jaws - Parallel jaw, V-jaw, Sampler jaw, Trident jaw, and Cutter. Each jaw has a different purpose and is tailored to a specific situation, which gives the user an array of options when using the Videoray Pro 4.</p>

      <h2>Parallel Jaw</h2>
      <p>The jaws of the Parallel Jaw move parallel to each other allowing it to grasp cylindrical objects such as pipes without slipping. This makes it ideal for untangling tether. The Parallel Jaw has a closing strength of 25 PSI, which is the maximum of any of the jaws.

      <h2>V-Jaw</h2>
      <p>The V-Jaw can open wider than the Parallel jaw, allowing it to grasp larger objects. The V-Jaw also has overlapping jaws that make it ideal for picking up bulky objects, especially netting.</p>

      <p>The Sampler Jaw allows operators to gather samples up to 45 ml. The sampler has a rubber gasket seal which prevents samples from escaping the jaw.</p>

      <h2>Trident</h2>
      <p>The Trident Jaw works like a "claw", which allows the Rotating Manipulator arm to pick up much larger objects than the VideoRay standard manipulator. The trident is able to grab objects that are circular. These objects can be difficult to grasp for the Parallel and V- Jaws.</p>

      <p>The Cutter has a cutting force of 36 kg (80 pounds) can slice through rope or cord up to 1.9 cm (0.75 inches).</p>
