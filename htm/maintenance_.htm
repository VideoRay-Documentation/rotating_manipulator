<h1>Maintenance Guide</h1>

<p>Always rinse and soak all submerged equipment in fresh water after use. After use, the Rotating Manipulator should be inspected for anything that may have gotten stuck in the jaw mechanism or rotation frame and pulley system.</p>

<p>All screws that are used to attach the jaw should be lubricated with Tef-Gel to prevent corrosion or seizure.</p>

<p>A silicon spray lubricant should be used periodically to lubricate the moving linkages of the jaws.</p>
